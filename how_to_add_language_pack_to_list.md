## How to add language pack to list ##

> [!NOTE]
> Note that language packs for `Japanese`, `English`, `Simplified Chinese`, `Traditional Chinese`, and `Korean` cannot be added to this list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are going to translate the game to a currently unsupported language, We urge you to use the original Japanese as the base and not the English version.
> Our English localization uses a lot of slang and colloquial metaphors and text is often moved around to help the flow of dialogue and/or make things more clear since the two languages are so vastly different.
> You run the same risks as "generation loss" if you translate from the English version.

### 1.Prepare a download link ###

It is recommended to create a zip file and upload it to Google Drive / OneDrive (you can provide a sharing link to a folder so that you can update the language pack without having to change the link in this list), so that players can preview the contents before downloading, ensuring no files other than those necessary for the Language Pack have been added.

### 2.Go to GitHub to submit a Pull Request ###

The page is currently hosted on GitHub, so you only need to go to GitHub, edit the `README.md` file in the repository, add information about your Language Pack, and submit a Pull Request.

If you are not familiar with Git, don’t worry. Simply visit the GitHub web version, click `Edit this file`, make your changes, and then click `Commit Changes`.

After submission, simply wait for us to confirm the basic information, and your Language Pack will be added to the list.
