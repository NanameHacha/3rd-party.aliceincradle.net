## How to add language pack to list ##

**Note that language packs for `Japanese`, `English`, `Simplified Chinese`, `Traditional Chinese`, and `Korean` cannot be added to this list.**

### 1.Prepare a download link ###

It is recommended to create a zip file and upload it to Google Drive / OneDrive, so that players can preview the contents before downloading, ensuring no files other than those necessary for the Language Pack have been added.

### 2.Go to GitHub to submit a Pull Request ###

The page is currently hosted on GitHub, so you only need to go to GitHub, edit the `README.md` file in the repository, add information about your Language Pack, and submit a Pull Request.

If you are not familiar with Git, don’t worry. Simply visit the GitHub web version, click `Edit this file`, make your changes, and then click `Commit Changes`.

After submission, simply wait for us to confirm the basic information, and your Language Pack will be added to the list.
